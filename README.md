# Customer-Churn-Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns and identify key factors contributing to churn in a telecommunications company. The analysis uses data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build predictive models that help the company understand and mitigate churn.

Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, allowing the company to take preventive actions.
Dataset
The dataset contains information about customers, including demographics, services subscribed, account details, and churn status. Key features include:
•	CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
•	Tenure: Duration of the customer's relationship with the company
•	MonthlyCharges: Monthly amount charged to the customer
•	TotalCharges: Total amount charged during the tenure
•	Churn: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No)
Project Objectives
1.	Understand the factors contributing to customer churn.
2.	Build predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.
3.	Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.
Methodology
1.	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data to identify trends and correlations.
3.	Feature Engineering: Created new features and encoded categorical variables.
4.	Modeling: Built and evaluated various models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
5.	Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Installation
To run this project locally, you need Python and the following libraries:
pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Clone the repository:

Usage
1.	Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data and perform analysis.
2.	Adjust parameters and test different models as needed.
Results
•	Identified key factors influencing churn, such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
•	Developed a predictive model with an accuracy of 76%, helping to identify at-risk customers.
Conclusion
The analysis highlights significant churn drivers and suggests strategies for retention, such as targeting specific customer segments with customized offers.
Future Work
•	Improve model performance with advanced techniques like deep learning.
•	Explore the impact of additional features such as customer sentiment or service feedback.
